      <h1> <strong>Hello World!</strong> </h1>
      <p>My name is Siddharth.</p>
      <p>I was born on January 5, 2018. It's me in the pictures!</p>
      <p>In the first picture I was six months old and in the second picture I am two and a half years old. I am a big boy now. My favorite activity is playing music on my music box!</p>
      <p>Shikha Mausi coded this webpage for me when she first learned to code. Not bad eh! I haven't seen her in a while because of this pandemic.</p>
      <p>Despite what's happening around the world right now, one good thing is that I get to spend more time with my Mumma & Papa.</p> 
      <p>I hope everything gets back to normal soon because I have so many things to do and places to go!</p>
      <p>Peace to the world.</p>
      <h2> <strong>Love to everyone!</strong> </h2>
